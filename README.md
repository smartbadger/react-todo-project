# Getting Started with Create React App

### Here's the task:

Using any react boilerplate setup of your choice (create react app etc.), create a todo list.

- Use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ to fetch and render initial todos (they have a /todo endpoint)
- Full CRUD functionality for todos
- Ability to create categories and place todos in each one
- Color code each todo based on what category it's in
- Not every todo will have a category (ex. the ones fetched at the beginning from jsonplaceholder). Make sure to handle this edge case in any way you want
  Ability to filter by category
- This is not a full-stack app, so todos and categories do not need to persist after page refresh (use state instead of actually passing to a backend). Only the todos fetched from jsonplaceholder will render on initial page load
